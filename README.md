# Continuation of Periodic Orbits in Conservative Hybrid Dynamical Systems

This repository contains implementations related to the paper titled "Continuation of Periodic Orbits in Conservative Hybrid Dynamical Systems and its Application to Mechanical Systems with Impulsive Dynamics". The code includes four examples from the paper, implemented in both Matlab and Julia.

1. **[Example 1]**: Bouncing Ball.
2. **[Example 2]**: Rocking Block.
3. **[Example 3]**: Bouncing Rod.
4. **[Example 4]**: SLIP-like model.

## Matlab Implementation
The Matlab code provided has been successfully tested within GNU Octave, ensuring compatibility and avoiding reliance on Matlab-specific toolboxes.

## Julia Implementation
The Julia code primarily utilizes the following packages:
- [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
- [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)

These packages are essential for solving ordinary differential equations and performing automatic differentiation, respectively.
